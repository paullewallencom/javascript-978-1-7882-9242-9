# rxjs-boilerplate

Steps of setting up the application:

```
1. npm install
2. npm run webpack:watch
3. python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```

The port used by the Python server will most likely be 8000. Visit

```
localhost:8000/index.html 
```

to run your application. In case you use Windows, you may have to replace step 3 with one of the following options:

- if you don't have any server-side logic included, simply drag and drop the `index.html` file in your browser
- set up Python and the simple HTTP server on Windows
- use a WAMP server
- enable bash in your Windows 10
- use Cygwin
