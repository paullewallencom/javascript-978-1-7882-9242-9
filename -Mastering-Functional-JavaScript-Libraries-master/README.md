# Mastering Functional JavaScript Libraries [Video]
This is the code repository for [Mastering Functional JavaScript Libraries [Video]](https://www.packtpub.com/web-development/mastering-functional-javascript-libraries-video?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781788292429), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.
## About the Video Course
The goal of this course is to give you hands-on experience with JavaScript functional programming libraries. You will discover throughout the course how easy it is to apply functional programming concepts in practice. 

In the first section, you will learn how different functional programming libraries implement automatic currying, partial application, lazy evaluation, higher-order functions, promises, cloning, chaining, function composition, and immutable data structures. You will execute code in Underscore.js, LoDash, Lazy.js, Ramda.js, Immutable.js, Scala, Elm, PureScript, and ClojureScript.

In order to learn how to use functional programming libraries in depth, in the second and third sections you will learn how to implement two web-applications using LoDash and RxJS.

The LoDash application shows you how to process matrixes with LoDash, by implementing a Sudoku game in JavaScript. We will model the Sudoku table with LoDash, collect all the constraints of the table, and validate it. The Sudoku table will be rendered using Underscore templating, and DOM events will help you manipulate state space with user interactions.

The third section introduces functional reactive programming using RxJS. Functional reactive programming deserves its own section, as it is a comprehensive topic providing you with a different developer experience from most of the other functional programming libraries. After learning the fundamentals of functional reactive programming and RxJS, you will learn how to put the theory into practice by implementing a web application. This web application uses the Slack API to monitor the activity of different Slack channels. Beyond submitting Ajax requests, you will also learn how to use web sockets to display live updates on your site using event streams.
